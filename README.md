# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis
A comprehensive Power BI project that provides valuable insights into customer churn patterns at a bank. This dashboard analyzes key metrics like customer demographics, account balances, and churn rates to help identify why customers leave the bank and what factors impact churn.

Problem Statement:
The bank aims to understand and analyze customer churn rates to improve retention strategies and enhance customer satisfaction. By utilizing bank data encompassing various attributes such as active membership status, age, balance, country, credit score, customer ID, estimated salary, lost customers, product number, and tenure, the bank seeks to identify patterns and factors contributing to churn. Specifically, the bank desires to examine churn status by gender, total customer count, total churn rate, and churn rate concerning credit score.

Churn Rate Explained:
Churn rate is like a "leaving rate" for customers. It shows the percentage of customers who stop using a company's product or service over a certain period.

Data Collection and Cleaning
The first step involves gathering and preparing the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.

Data Sources: Bank records covering customer details such as active membership status, age, balance, country, credit score, and more. Data Cleaning: Handle any missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.

Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables and the relationships between them.
Key areas of focus:

Churn Status by Gender: Explore how churn rates vary between male and female customers. Credit Score Distribution: Examine the credit scores of churned vs. retained customers to identify risk groups.

Visual Insights:
Churn Status by Gender: Compares the count of churned and retained customers by gender using bar plots and pie charts. Total Customer Count: Displays the total number of customers in the dataset. Total Churn Rate: Calculates and displays the overall churn rate as a percentage. Churn Rate by Credit Score: Groups customers by credit score ranges and visualizes churn rates within each group using bar charts and line charts.

Conclusion:
The Bank Churn Analysis Dashboard provides key insights into customer churn patterns, helping the bank make data-driven decisions to improve retention strategies. By analyzing metrics such as gender, age, and credit scores, it identifies key factors driving churn.
